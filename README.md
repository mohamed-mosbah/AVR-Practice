Practicing Embedded Software Development on ATMega32

This is for tracking my code while practicing coding different drivers for ATMega32 

# MCAL
>The Microcontroller Abstraction Layer (MCAL) is the lowest software layer of the Basic Software. It is uC dependent and contains drivers to enable the access of on-chip peripheral devices of a microcontroller and off-chip memory mapped peripheral devices by a defined API. The purpose is to make higher software layers independent of the microcontroller.
Implemented MCAL Drivers till now are:
* DIO

# HAL
>The Hardware abstraction layer (HAL) allows the microcontroller to interact with a hardware device at a general or abstract level rather than at a detailed hardware level.
Implemented HAL Drivers till now are:

* Character LCD
* Keypad
